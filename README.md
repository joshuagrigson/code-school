# Code School — `code-lab.html`

The complete Kindergarten-through-College coding class in one self-contained,
offline HTML file. Download it (or copy it to `C:\code-school\`), double-click,
and it runs in any browser with **zero network access and zero API usage**.

## What's inside — 57 lessons, 14 grades

| Grades | Territory |
|---|---|
| K–1 | HTML: tags, attributes, lists, buttons, links, boxes |
| 2–3 | CSS: colors, spacing, borders, classes and ids |
| 4–6 | JavaScript: `screen.textContent`, variables, strings vs numbers, lists, random |
| 7 | Functions — teach, ingredients, `return`, functions calling functions (4 lessons) |
| 8 | Choices — if, else, else-if chains, `&&`/`\|\|` (4 lessons) |
| 9 | Loops — for, for...of, nesting, while (4 lessons) |
| 10 | Build the Excuse-O-Matic in three staged sittings (3 lessons) |
| 11 | Objects — labels, dot access, lists of objects, changing state (4 lessons) |
| 12 | Debugging — console.log, reading errors, typeof, guarding input (4 lessons) |
| College | Naming, one-job functions, DRY, the Mood Machine final project, graduation (5 lessons) |

Lesson indices 0–28 match the original build exactly, and the `CARRIED` seed
preserves Josh's progress (28/57, resuming at "Picking at random") in any fresh
browser. Real progress lives in `localStorage` under `codeschool` and always
wins over the seed.

## Features

- Live preview on every keystroke; JS lessons enforce the house rule —
  *working it out is not showing it* — via the universal `.textContent =` check
  plus a `new Function` syntax gate with friendly error rewrites.
- **Give me a lead** reveals the answer in 4 word-snapped steps (scaffold, don't solve).
- **Ask a question**: offline keyword-matched answer bank (32 entries).
- **Free play** sandbox (self-saving, uncheckable, unbreakable).
- Per-grade redo buttons, REMEMBER strip per language, reading level that
  "ages up" with the grades.

After College graduation the course sends learners off to build a small real project of their own — the school is deliberately self-contained.

## For maintainers

The parser traps from the original build still apply: the inline script must
never contain the literal sequences for a closing body tag, an HTML comment
opener, or script open/close tags — they are built via string concatenation or
escaped (`safeJs`, `'<scr'+'ipt>'`). Test with the recipe in the original
HANDOFF: serve locally, click every lesson's "Show me" (all must pass) and
"Start over" (none may pass), and verify stripped-output solutions fail.

## For skeptics

If you're a working developer looking at the kindergarten vocabulary and the
confetti and thinking "these kids and their shortcuts" — this section is for you.

**The pedagogy, straight:**

- **Everything is typed by hand.** No copy-paste, no autocomplete, no AI at
  runtime. The file makes zero network calls; a learner cannot outsource the
  typing that builds the skill.
- **Errors are the curriculum.** A syntax gate (`new Function` parse) blocks
  green ticks on broken code; a structural linter explains unclosed tags,
  blocks-inside-paragraphs, and empty CSS values in plain English instead of
  letting browser error-recovery hide them. Learners are deliberately made to
  cause and read errors.
- **The kid-terms are scaffolding with a demolition date.** Every "hug/box/trick"
  lesson carries a *Real name* panel (element/tag, variable, function, parameter,
  return value, conditional, iteration, state, property). Graduates exit
  speaking standard vocabulary.
- **No magic survives to graduation.** The pre-wired `screen`/`btn` handles are
  revealed as `document.getElementById` in Grade 12 — and learners write the
  real version. The checker itself is disclosed as plain JavaScript. Free play
  invites them to view-source the whole school.
- **Simplifications are labeled.** Where the material simplifies (browser error
  recovery, zero-indexing, pseudo-randomness), a collapsible "the full truth"
  note says so and states the precise version.
- **Reviews are placement exams.** Every grade ends with a cumulative review;
  passing one *first* test-outs the whole grade (marked ⚡). Experienced learners
  fast-forward to their actual gaps; beginners get consolidation checkpoints.
- **Restraint on gamification.** XP and confetti celebrate; there are no streaks,
  timers, lives, or leaderboards. Motivation without engagement-farming.

**The audit invitation:** it's one dependency-free HTML file. Open it. Read the
checker (`runCheck`), the linter (`htmlLint`), the highlighter, the lesson data.
Then judge. Issues and pull requests welcome.
